This repo is a companion repo to the [blog repo](https://github.com/sourcevault/sourcevault.github.io).

My [personal site](sourcevault.github.io/) is built using the code in this repo.

It is powered using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/), thanks to all the developers who made both of them possible üôè.

Since there is not a lot of tutorials out there regarding how to use **both**, I have tried to make it easy to go through this repo for newbies.

This repo contains **only** files that are not auto-generated by hugo, this makes it easy to understand how to use hugo and PaperMod.
