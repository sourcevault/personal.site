*a tale of keys, keyboard and travel overseas.*

### How it started

I used to suffer from severve RSI from 2016 to around 2019, this long post is about what I have learnt so far regarding this strange disease and how I finally got my fingers back. Nowadays I can type without not even thinking about RSI, something that I considered impossible. I hope people suffering from RSI can learn something useful from my experience.

Back before I had RSI, I used to type on a laptop keyboard, the laptop I was using at that time was a thinkpad X1 carbon. I remember writing a +4000 word long essay, and while typing, I started feeling minor pain between my middle finger and index finger. 

At the start I completely ignored it, since it did not seem to be such a big deal, I had my gym gloves, so I started wearing that while typing thinking it would make a difference. I could not be more wrong.

The pain spread from the *small wedge* between the middle and index finger to the thumb, pinky and first finger. Within the same day it started effecting both hands and had to completely cease all typing and any activity that required my fingers. 

Essentially, there was severve pain in each of my finger joints.

### The pain

The best way to describe the pain would be pins and needles, or tinkling that follows the heart rate. The pin and needle would hit at each heartbeat ( you could feel your heartbeat in your finger joints ), it would continue until I stopped using my hands. 

The pain extended all the way from the finger joints to the wrist and finally to the area just below the elbow, by this point typing on a computer was equivalent to torture. One strange thing about my RSI, is that there was no pain while typing on a smartphone, but this was not always a given, eventually if I contined texting on my smartphone without giving my fingers sufficient rest, the base of my thumb would start hurting, so I had to be careful.

Cold made the pain worse, while heat reduced the pain, at the start of the day, the pain would be minimal and increase as I did more activity using my hands.

### First Ergonomic Keyboard

The first thing I did was try to find out what was actually going on and tried reading about the issue as much as I could, the literature on RSI is minimal, both offline and on the web. 

Prior to the pain, I was compeletely unaware of the concept of ergonomics, when it came to using the computer, but it seems you have to pay attention to a lot of things like posture, chair and optimal hand positioning. if you intend to spend long hours sitting infront of a computer. Since the pain started from typing on the keyboard, it made sense to get a more ergonomic one. I purchased my first ergonomic keyboard - Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic, the hope was that the keyboard would solve everything, it also came with an ergonomic mouse.

The ergonomic keyboard or mouse did not help, I started seeing different doctors - Rheumatologist, Orthopedics, Physical therapists, but regardless of the speciality, almost every doctor gave the same advice - to take as much rest. The issue was that it did not work, even if you spent months not typing, it would come back as soon as you started typing, using any contraption like hand braces, to minimize joint movement, actually made the pain worse.
