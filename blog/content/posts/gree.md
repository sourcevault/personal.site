It's not everyday you get to buy a new AC unit, I though it would be a good idea to finally take some thermal images of the coils that do all the work in a heat exchanger.

ðŸ”µ *condenser unit (outdoor), placed near window*

ðŸ“‹ Data Sheet ( as per manufacturer ).

- **GREE** GSH-12PUV410, 1 Ton.

- Inverter.

- 12000 BTU.

- Hot + Cold.

- Refrigerant Type - R22

- Operating current : 6.0 Amp

- Power Consumption : 1250 Watt.

Since I had a amp meter, I did a site reading of the operating currrent. My main's voltage was 218V, while my amp meter was showing A<sub>min</sub> ~ 2.1 and A<sub>max</sub>  ~ 6.2 Amp.

So it seems my AC unit was consuming **~ 460 Watts** while operating at it's low setting, and **1,351 Watt** at full capacity.

Now time to take some thermal images  ...

ðŸ”µ outdoor unit / thermal image ( distant )

{{< figure src="./close_up.jpg#center" width="60%">}}

ðŸ”µ close up of colder coil in unit, temperature difference of ~10Â°C between coil.

{{< figure src="./heat_far.jpg#center" width="60%">}}

ðŸ”µ using red, outdoor temperature is 30Â°C, hottest coil is at 46Â°C. ( 16Â°C differential ).

The images was taken after 2 hours of operation, to give the AC time to fully pass on the gasses into all the coils, it was quite peculiar to see two coils being ~ 6 degree colder than the others, was there some sort of blockage, preventing the gas from reaching ?

I did not expect there to be cold coils in the condenser unit at all, especially since it's a brand new unit !

I had so many questions, is it normal for condenser coils to have thermal gaps ? especially new units ?
